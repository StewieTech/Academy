## FOUR OOP Concepts

---
### Encapsulation
```
Math has static methods meaning that we can run their methods within the class level without having to initiate the objects. The math class is a great example of static methods as they literally list the default constructor as private so nobody can initiate them
```
---
### Inheritance
```
Every class extends the Object class meaning that we can use all of the defined methods of the Object class.

```

---
### Polymorphism
```
It happens when a method or constructor takes different forms

Two types:
-Overloading
-Overriding
-- The @Override annotation is an informative annotation that checks if the annotated method name and parameters exist in the parent class


```
---
### Abstraction
```
We can implment abstration with
- Interfaces
-- An Interface is a template (similar to a class) where we declare (not define) methods that must be implemented by a class

interface Income {
    double calculate(double salary, double taxes);
}

public class Interface Example {
    public static void(String[] args) {

    }

    class Employee implements Income {

    @Override
    public double calculatePay(double salary, double taxes) {
        return salary
    }
    // The IDE can do this specifically
    }
}


- Abstract Methods
-there are class, abstract class, and interfaces


In Java, abstraction is also implemented using interfaces. An interface is like a template that contains method  declarations (not including the body of the methods) and constants. A class that implements an interface must provide the implementations (body of the method) for all of the interface’s methods.
